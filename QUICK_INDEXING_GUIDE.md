### 5. Check Current Indexing Status
```
Search in Google:
site:metic.ai/artificial-intelligence-ai-services-in-alabama

If nothing shows = Not indexed yet
If shows = Already indexed!
```

### 6. Submit to Bing Webmaster Tools
```
1. Go to: https://www.bing.com/webmasters
2. Add/verify your site if not done
3. Submit sitemap: https://metic.ai/sitemap.xml
4. Use "URL Submission" tool for Alabama page
```

## 🔍 MONITOR DAILY (5 minutes/day)

### Check Progress:
```
Day 1: Check if sitemap is processing
Day 3: Check if pages appear in "Discovered" status
Day 7: Check if pages move to "Indexed" status
Day 14: All priority pages should be indexed
```

### Where to Check:
1. Google Search Console → Coverage Report
2. Look for these statuses:
   - ✅ "Valid" = Indexed successfully
   - ⚠️ "Discovered - not indexed" = Google knows about it, waiting
   - ⚠️ "Crawled - not indexed" = Needs more authority/backlinks
   - ❌ "Excluded" = Problem! Check why

## 🎯 BUILD AUTHORITY (Ongoing)

### Why Pages Might Not Index:
Google may see your pages but not think they're important enough. Fix this by:

1. **Internal Linking** - Add links FROM your homepage TO location pages
2. **External Backlinks** - Get other sites to link to you
3. **Social Signals** - Share on social media
4. **Traffic** - Drive visitors to the pages

### Quick Wins:
```
✅ Add "Locations" section on homepage linking to top 10 state pages
✅ Create blog posts that link to location pages
✅ Share Alabama page on LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook
✅ Submit to business directories with your URL
✅ Create press release about AI services in Alabama
```
