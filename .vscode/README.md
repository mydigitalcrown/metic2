## How to Use

When you open this project in VS Code, you'll be prompted to install recommended extensions. Click "Install All" to set up the optimal development environment.

### Manual Extension Installation

If the prompt doesn't appear:
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+X` (Mac)
2. Type "@recommended" in the search box
3. Install all recommended workspace extensions

## Customization

These are workspace settings that apply only to this project. They won't affect your global VS Code settings.

To customize:
1. Open `.vscode/settings.json`
2. Add or modify settings as needed
3. Save the file

### Common Customizations

**Change tab size:**
```json
"editor.tabSize": 4
```

**Disable format on save:**
```json
"editor.formatOnSave": false
```

**Change default formatter:**
```json
"editor.defaultFormatter": "another.formatter"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Settings not applying
- Restart VS Code
- Check that you've opened the project folder (not just a file)
- Ensure the `.vscode` folder is at the project root

### Extensions not working
- Install recommended extensions
- Reload VS Code window (`Ctrl+Shift+P` â†’ "Developer: Reload Window")
- Check extension requirements (some need npm packages installed)

### Prettier/ESLint conflicts
- The workspace settings are configured to use Prettier as the formatter and ESLint for linting
- Make sure both extensions are installed and enabled

## Version Control

The `.vscode/` folder is tracked in Git to ensure all team members have the same development environment. However:
- User-specific settings (like font size, theme) should be in your global settings
- Workspace settings here are for project-specific configurations only
